# Changelog
All notable changes to this project will be documented in this file.

There is an attempt to adhere to [Semantic Versioning](https://semver.org/).

## [Unreleased](https://github.com/php1ic/inch/tree/master)

Lots has happened since [0.9.7](https://github.com/php1ic/inch/releases/tag/v0.9.7) and and there has been no attempt at versioning.
I'm not even going to try and list the all the changes, more accurate book keeping will start with the next release.

Major things are:
- Move to cmake for building
- Compile against C++14
- CI support for gitlab, travis and appveyor
- Embrace OOP, remove all free functions and refactor functionality into separate classes


## [[0.9.7]](https://github.com/php1ic/inch/releases/tag/v0.9.7) - 2014-05-12

This was mainly learning how to tag rather than any specific milestone.
