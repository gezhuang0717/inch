		INCH - The Interactive Nuclear CHart

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

INCH is an open source project aimed at providing a simple method of
creating high quality (preferably vector graphic) images of a bespoke
region of the nuclear, sometimes referred to as Segre, chart.

The code reads data from either the Atomic Mass Evaluation or NUBASE
table to create the chart. Both of which are freely available as ASCII
files from http://amdc.in2p3.fr/web/amdcw_en.html.

The local directory structure is:

.
|-- bin
|-- data_files
|-- include
|-- obj
|-- src

Hopefully this is fairly self explanatory, any files in ./bin/ or ./obj/
are overwritten at compliation so should not be manually altered.
Any changes to files in ./src/ or ./include/ will require recompilation and
files in ./data_files/ are used to create the chart. The following files
should *NOT* be altered:

FRLDM_ME.tbl
mass.mas114
nubtab03.asc

The remaining files are used for extra functionality and in some cases
are recreated if not present. As always, if you aren't sure, don't change
it and if you do, backup!

Please read the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

- Creation of the eps file
  * with all functionality is complete bar minor tweaks/bug fixes.

- Creation of the svg file
  * is at the basic stage, a general function exists to position, create
  and colour the box. The addition of nuclei text is in progress.

- Creation of the tikz file
  * is at the basic stage, a general function exists to position, create
  and colour the box whilst adding text.
