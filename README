		INCH - The Interactive Nuclear CHart

//////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////////

INCH is an open source project aimed at providing a simple method of
creating high quality (preferably vector graphic) images of a bespoke
region of the nuclear, sometimes referred to as Segre, chart.

The code may be freely copied, distributed and altered under the
terms of the GNU GPL license. Please read the file COPYING, which
should be located at the root of the project, for full details.

No guarantee is supplied with regards to the accuracy of the data
presented. Estimated values are included, please always refer to the
original sources. All data should, however, be accurate.

Suggestions/improvements are encouraged (bugs less so), you can either
contact the author or implement the change and send a pull request
via github - https://github.com/php1ic/inch

The code reads data from:
- The Atomic Mass Evaluation
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375947403018098
- The NUBASE evaluation of nuclear and decay properties
https://www.sciencedirect.com/science/article/pii/S0375947403018098

Both of these are freely available as ASCII files from
http://amdc.in2p3.fr/web/amdcw_en.html.

The local directory structure is:

.
|-- bin
|-- data_files
|-- include
|-- obj
|-- src

Hopefully this is fairly self explanatory, any files in ./bin/ or ./obj/
are overwritten at compilation so should not be manually altered.
Any changes to files in ./src/ or ./include/ will require recompilation
and files in ./data_files/ are used to create the chart.

The following files should *NOT* be altered:

FRLDM_ME.tbl
mass.mas114
nubtab03.asc

Any other files in ./data_files/ are used for extra functionality and in
some cases are recreated if not present. As always, if you aren't sure,
don't change it and if you do, backup!

Please read the file INSTALL for installation instructions.

- Creation of the eps file
  * with all functionality is complete bar minor tweaks/bug fixes.

- Creation of the svg file
  * is at the basic stage, a general function exists to position, create
  and colour the box. The addition of nuclei text is in progress.

- Creation of the tikz file
  * is at the basic stage, a general function exists to position, create
  and colour the box whilst adding text.
