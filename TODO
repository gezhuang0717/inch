==========
Known Bugs
==========

- convertFloatToExponent assumes that the value of the float will be <1
as was written with dm/m in mind.

- The format of the data file containing user defined nuclei is not
check/validated.

================================
Things that need to be looked at (Not quite bugs)
================================

- The population of the 'decay' member of an isotope needs to be looked
at in relation to isotopes that have many different values/possibilities

- The fonts used in the eps version of the charts are not easily available
with the version of texlive that comes with fedora. Thus, if used in a
latex document and the user does dvi->ps (using dvips) characters can get
'lost'. This is most obvious in the key. Not sure if this is an issue with
INCH or just an artefact of the licensing rules that fedora follow.

=================================
Possible improvements/alterations (in no particular order)
=================================

- Use useful exit values if we quit out before completion, e.g. 10=no mass table
11=bad input file, etc...

- The default EPS file is automatically overwritten if no output file is given.
Either make it so the user needs to ALWAYS specify a file name or add the
option not to overwrite it.

- Add a comment about how the drip lines were calculated.

- It is harder to select by N than by A, make selection by A possible.

- Add the option for spin and parity colouring. Not sure what the choices
would be beyond odd/even.

- Add the option for colouring by higher isomeric states.
The mass table seems fairly selective on the non-ground state states
included so this may not be very good. Not sure how complete the first isomer
list actually is.

- If the nuclei also decays via another branch with a non negligible fraction
(>5%) alter how it is displayed (may need to be quantitative, could get messy).

- Write isotopic abundances in the stable isotopes, again could get messy.

- Have option to print out the details for a specific isotope. The information
is already collected, this could be an option at the start.
Either draw a chart or get info for an isotope.

- Add comments about how to alter the text in the box. Perhaps make a guide,
explaining both the basics of the postscript code and how to make changes once
the chart is created.
