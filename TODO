Known Bugs

=================================
Possible improvements/alterations (in no particlar order)
=================================

- The default EPS file is automatically overwritten if no output file is given. Either make it so the user needs to ALWAYS specify a file name or add the option not to overwrite it.

- Add a comment about how the drip lines were calculated.

- It is harder to select by N than by A, make selection by A possible.

- Add the option for spin and parity colouring. Not sure what the choices would be beyond odd/even.

- Add the option for colouring by higher isomeric states.
  The mass table seems fairly selective on the non-ground state states included so this may not be very good. Not sure how complete the first isomer list actually is.

- Have option to draw S_2n and S_2p drip lines. Program for S_n and S_p drip lines can already do this, would just need to add option to main source code and create the files.
  Calculate separation energies and dV_pn, for all nuclei. Either include display option or add to info that couls be printed out.

- If the nuclei also decays via another branch with a non negligible fraction (>5%) alter how it is displayed (may need to be quantitative, could get messy)

- Write isotopic abundances in the stable istopes, again could get messy.

- Have option to print out the details for a specific isotope. The information is already collected, this could be an option at the start. Either draw a chart or get info for an isotope.

- Add comments about how to alter the text in the box. Perhaps make a guide, explaining both the basics of the postscipt code and how to make changes once the chart is created.
