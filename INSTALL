		INCH Installation

The standard "make" should suffice, this will create the executable
in the ./bin/ directory. The executable reads files located in
<install path>/data_files/ so can be moved into your $PATH if required.
There is no "make install" currently implemented.

Full functionality is available when created an eps file, either a svg or 
tikz file can also be created but will only have the basic features.
To alter the file type that is produced, the following line must be changed,
and the program re-compiled.

    $ grep -n file_type src/inputs.cpp 
    58:  file_type         = 0;       // 0=eps, 1=svg, 2=tikz;


The script "convert_chart.sh" is a BASH script that uses ghostscript and
rsvg-convert (provided through librsvg2) to carry out the following file
conversions:

     eps -> png,jpg,pdf
     svg -> pdf

This should run without the need for any installation by the user.
